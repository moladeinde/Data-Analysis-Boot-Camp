# Introduction
The repository contains a hands-on Bootcamp class I took in 2019 with an IT company that is based in Arizona with experts that work with students and small businesses for all data needs. Their curriculum meets my professional needs in data analytics. The Bootcamp took 20 weeks, and it enabled the students to learn how to code by query data from SQL databases and use excel to summarize extensive data to extract valuable information. The course also includes using PowerBI and python. During the 20 weeks, we learned how to model data and understand the difference between structured, semi-structured, and non-structured data.
